# Potion Unlock Actions

This directory contains the different whitelists and credits that have been executed for the Potion Unlock sale. Each file will use the following naming convention:

`Batch{number}_{RarityName}_(Credit | Whitelist).txt`

Where:

-   **number** is the number of the batch. Batch numbers are consecutive. This will help identify the last executed batch
-   **RarityName** is informative and just to understand which rarity the batch belongs to
-   **LAST_EXECUTED_BATCH.md** contains the number of the last batch that has been succesfully executed
